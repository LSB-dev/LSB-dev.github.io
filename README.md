## Publicly Available Datasets For Electric Load Forecasting
![Header1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06fd4a8-9dea-462b-bc8f-ce1002430c12)

[This repository](https://github.com/LSB-dev/Publicly-Available-Datasets-For-Electric-Load-Forecasting) was created to provide a **curated list of the most popular electric load forecasting (LF)** datasets, simplifying the search for researchers and practitioners. Finding suitable datasets can be challenging, so the goal was to identify and **make publicly accessible data easier** to locate and use.

The datasets were identified through a comprehensive review of representative publications, then extracted, structured, and analyzed. **Contributions** are welcome‚Äîwhether feedback, suggestions, or new datasets. Join us in enhancing this resource by submitting a pull request!

Many thanks to V. Chandramouli for his outstanding support and excellent cooperation.
